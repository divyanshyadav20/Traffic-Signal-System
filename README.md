# Traffic Signal System

## This project is an Atmega16 microcontroller based Traffic Signal System in which I have used 8 LEDs and 2 7SEGMENTS to denote the signals of a traffic light.

### Software Used:

**1) Proteus 7 Professional**

Proteus is a software for microprocessor simulation, schematic capture, and printed circuit board (PCB) design. The Proteus Professional demonstration is intended for prospective customers who wish to evaluate professional level products.
